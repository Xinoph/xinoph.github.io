Hello everyone! This marks the official launch of my new portfolio site hosted on Github pages!

I would like to express a huge thanks to [{{ site.contributors.scott.name }}]({{ site.contributors.scott.url }}) for showing and helping me with Jekyll. Be sure to check out his stuff.

My work ranges from fun and sometimes silly games to cute animations to portraits of people.
Software I use include Photoshop, Maya, zBrush, Unity3D, Marmoset Toolbag, and Allegorithmic's Substance Design and Painter.

This blog will both serve as a way to document how I grow as a creator and to show the readers my thought processes and progress of things I am working on.

If you notice a bug with the site, I would greatly appreciate it if you let me know either down in the comments or in an email.

Thanks for visiting, and please stop by again later!
