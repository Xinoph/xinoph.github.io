Yesterday, May 30th, I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with Bachelor of Science dual majors in <i>Games and Simulation Arts and Sciences</i> and <i>Electronic Arts</i> and a minor in <i>Computer Science</i>.

It's been a great and fast four years. I've met a ton of awesome people, built some friendships that I hope will last forever, and create lots of cool art and games.

I can't wait to see what my next four years will be like. :)
