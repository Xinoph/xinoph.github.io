Next week, I will be representing Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at the [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) in San Francisco.  We will be showing off [Radioland](/projects/games/radioland) along with other RPI games.

As for my personal work, I have been cranking away at my thesis and dabbling into graphics programming with OpenGL. I'll be sure to post some updates to my work soon.
