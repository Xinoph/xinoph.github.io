For those of you around Troy, NY or those who like to travel, from April 22nd to 25th, RPI is hosting its Electronic Art (EART) and Electronic Media, Arts, & Communication (EART) senior art show at the Fulton Street Gallery.

I and 23 other students will be presenting our work in all kinds of multimedia, such as 3D animations, installations, books, films, board games, apps, and more!

I will have an interactive station showing [Zhu FeiTian](/projects/3d/zhufeitian).

If you have a chance, please come check out all of our cool works!
