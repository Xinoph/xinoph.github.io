Now after graduation, I am working on my own mobile game with targeted platform of Android devices.

More information and pictures soon to come as more progress is made.

The battle system has been prototyped. This is going through extensive testing, especially on mobile devices. The out of battle systems and some more art need to be made, then it should be ready to be revealed.

I hope to start a dev blog about the project after all prototype systems have been finalized.
