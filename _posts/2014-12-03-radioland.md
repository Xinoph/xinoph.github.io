<h3>Overview</h3>

This game was the result of three months of work in <a href="http://www.arts.rpi.edu/~ruiz/EGDFall2014/Experimental.htm">Experimental Game Design</a> and we plan to continue development in the spring of 2015. We used Unity3D with C#.

Radioland is a single player 3D third-person puzzle platformer set on a chain of floating islands. The player controls Gunther as he explores four season-themed levels. As the player navigates through jumping challenges, they search for and collect audio logs. These audio logs reveal snippets of four narratives each focusing on communication.
