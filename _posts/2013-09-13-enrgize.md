<h3>Overview</h3>

EnRgize is a single player arcade game programmed in C++ with OpenFrameworks. All visual elements are created in code.

The objective is to bounce the white balls into the goal. The goal only accepts balls that have been electrically charged. A ball becomes charged when it bounces off a player-generated electric wall, and loses its charge when it bounces off the game's boundary walls.

<h3>My Contributions</h3>

Designed the gameplay and used code to create visual elements

* Used C++ to...
    * Create the subtle animated background that is pleasing to watch. 
    * Lay out the keyboard control buttons. 
    * Control the 'color space' for the randomly chosen colors
    * Program the bouncing physics of the balls.
